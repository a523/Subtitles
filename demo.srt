88
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:39,398
So we're concerned about--

89
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:51,310
--efficient procedures-- for
solving large scale problems

90
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:51,940
in this class.

91
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:01,640
And we're concerned
about scalability,

92
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:07,030
because-- just as,
you know, 1,000

93
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:09,600
was a big number a
couple of decades ago,

94
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,140
and now it's kind of
a small number-- it's

95
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:16,430
quite possible that by the
time you guys are professors

96
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,220
teaching this class
in some university

97
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,690
that a trillion is going
to be a small number.
